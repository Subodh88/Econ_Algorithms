# Overwiew of the repository
The repository contains a collection of number of econometric models used for prediction and classification. I have provided the codes as these models are not available in any standard packages. Majority of the models are applicable in domains such as **Marketing**, **Travel behavior**, and **land-use analysis**. 
The codes are either in _**python**_ or _**Gauss language**_. Few of the codes are available in both languages. The  _**Gauss language**_ is similar to _**MATLAB**_ and easy to follow. I am working on converting _**Gauss language**_ into _**python**_.
You can contact me directly at **subbits@gmail.com** for any clarification.
