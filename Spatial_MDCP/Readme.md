# Paper Title
The code is for the paper titled _**A new spatial multiple discrete‚Äêcontinuous modeling approach to land use change analysis**_. You can access the paper [**Here**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jors.12201). This model allows for a joint modeling of both choice and quantity along with explicit spatial dependencies. This model is highly applicable in Marketing and land-use analysis literature. Ex: One can model what grocery item an individual may purchase along with the associated quantity. The model explicity accounts for satiation effect in order for the prediction to be economically consistent.   

# Paper Abstract
_This paper formulates a multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP) land use model within a spatially explicit economic structural framework for land use change decisions. The spatial MDCP model is capable of predicting both the type and intensity of urban development patterns over large geographic areas, while also explicitly acknowledging geographic proximity-based spatial dependencies in these patterns. At a methodological level, the paper focuses on specifying and estimating a spatial MDCP model that allows the dependent variable to exist in multiple discrete states with an intensity associated with each discrete state. The formulation also accommodates spatial dependencies, as well as spatial heterogeneity and heteroskedasticity, in the dependent variable, and should be applicable in a wide variety of fields where social and spatial dependencies between decision agents (or observation units) lead to spillover effects in multiple discrete-continuous choices (or states). A simulation exercise is undertaken to evaluate the ability of the proposed maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach to recover parameters from a cross-sectional spatial MDCP model. The results show that the MACML approach does well in recovering parameters. An empirical demonstration of the approach is undertaken using the city of Austin parcel level land use data._

# Code Content
The code provides user the oppurtunity to replicate the simulation study reported int he paper. The code is properly commented for a easy follow through. With a little effort, users can modify the code to include external dataset. The file _SMDCP_finalversion.gss_ contains all the necessary functions and no additional file is required.

# Dependencies
Users will require Gauss IDE to run the code along with Maimum likelihood module. See [here for more details](https://www.aptech.com/).
